I'm Sam.

I'm originally from [a small town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedlington) a little bit north of Newcastle, but by this point I think I've pretty much lost my accent.

After [university](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/) I moved North of the Wall to my adopted home city of Glasgow, Scotland - where I've been for the last 10+ years now.

My fianc√©e, Amy, and I currently live a bit west of Glasgow with our ~~small chaos demon~~ golden retriever, [Jura](https://www.instagram.com/jura_the_golden/)[^1] (named for [the island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jura,_Scotland) and [the whisky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jura_distillery)).

I'm a big fan of minimalism, so if this site appears a bit spartan it's by design.

## Dev work :computer::monkey:

I've been doing software-adjacent things professionally for a while now.<!--  across [a few different gigs](/experience) and [a pile of different tech](/skills).-->

While I usually start a new project as some kind of "developer", this usually ends up with me just looking for the nearest *broken thing* and trying to make it *less broken / on fire* (code, builds, infra, team dynamics - there's no shortage of broken stuff to choose from).

I feel pretty lucky that I've stumbled into a career where I get paid to solve puzzles - the trade-off is having work stuff spinning away on background threads in my head outside office hours, but that hasn't been a big issue so far.
